**Deskflow** is a free and open source keyboard and mouse sharing app.
Use the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad of one computer to control nearby computers,
and work seamlessly between them.

**Wayland support:** Experimental support in 
[Deskflow v1.16](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/releases/tag/1.16.0-beta%2Br2)
(required >= GNOME 46 or KDE Plasma 6.1).

![Deskflow GUI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/883660dc-f3f5-4b69-8821-a079a58d3882)

To use Deskflow you can follow the [Build Quick Start](#build-quick-start),
use one of our packages, or if it's available by your favorite package repository,
install `deskflow` (see: [installing packages](#how-to-install-packages)).

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸš€ **Deskflow** is now the upstream project for Synergy.
>
> The Deskflow project was established to cultivate community-driven development where everyone can collaborate.
>
> Synergy supports and contributes to the Deskflow project while maintaining its customer-oriented code downstream.

## Project Values

- Motivated by the community interests (not business-driven)
- Privacy by default (e.g. update check is off by default)
- Nothing customer-related (this is all moved downstream to Synergy)
- Leading edge releases (we don't focus on supporting older systems)
- Decisions are discussed and documented publicly with majority rule
- Have fun; we don't need to worry about impressing anyone

## Ways to get involved

Here are a few ways to join in with the project and get involved:
* Build the latest `master` version (see below) and [report a bug](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/issues)
* [Submit a PR](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Contributing) (pull request) with a bug fix or improvement
* [Let us know](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/issues) if you have an idea for an improvement

## Build Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> Check the [Build Guide](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Build-Guide)
> wiki page if you have problems.

## Operating Systems

We support all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix-like BSD-derived.

All Linux distributions are supported, primarily focusing on: 
Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, Arch Linux, openSUSE, Gentoo.

We officially support FreeBSD, and would also like to support: OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly, Solaris.

## Repology

Repology monitors a huge number of package repositories and other sources comparing package
versions across them and gathering other information.

[![Repology](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/deskflow.svg?exclude_unsupported=1)](https://repology.org/project/deskflow/versions)


**Note:** We are working with package maintainers to have our new package name adopted.

## Collaborative Projects

In the open source developer community, similar projects collaborate for the betterment of all
mouse and keyboard sharing tools. We aim for idea sharing and interoperability.

* [**Lan Mouse**](https://github.com/feschber/lan-mouse) -
  Rust implementation with the goal of having native front-ends and interoperability with
  Deskflow/Synergy.
* [**Input Leap**](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap) -
  Deskflow/Synergy-derivative with the goal of continuing what Barrier started, after Barrier
  became a dead fork.
* [**Synergy**](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Relationship-with-Synergy) -
  Downstream commercial fork and Deskflow sponsor, geared toward adapting to customer
  needs, offering business and enterprise licensing.

## FAQ

### Is Deskflow compatible with Lan Mouse or Input Leap?

We would love to see compatibility between our fellow open source projects, Lan Mouse and 
Input Leap. This idea is discussed occasionally in the communities for all of our projects,
so it may happen in the not-too-distant future.

### If I want to solve issues in Deskflow do I need to contribute to a fork?

We welcome PRs (pull requests) from the community. If you'd like to make a change, please feel
free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/discussions) or 
[open a PR](https://github.com/deskflow/deskflow/wiki/Contributing).

### Is clipboard sharing supported?

Absolutely. The clipboard-sharing feature is a cornerstone feature of the product and we are 
committed to maintaining and improving that feature.

### Is Wayland for Linux supported?

Yes! Wayland (the Linux display server protocol aimed to become the successor of the X Window 
System) is an important platform for us.
The [`libei`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libei) and 
[`libportal`](https://github.com/flatpak/libportal) libraries enable 
Wayland support for Deskflow. We would like to give special thanks to Peter Hutterer,
who is the author of `libei`, a major contributor to `libportal`, and the author of the Wayland
implementation in Deskflow. Others such as Olivier Fourdan and Povilas Kanapickas helped with the
Wayland implementation.

### Where did it all start?

Deskflow was first created as Synergy in 2001 by Chris Schoeneman.

wiki.
